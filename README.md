# spotify_sql_analysis
Spotify SQL Project exploring a real dataset with schema design, data cleaning, and EDA. Includes easy, medium, and advanced queries using aggregates, joins, CTEs, and window functions to analyze tracks, artists, albums, and streaming performance across platforms.
# 🎵 Spotify SQL Project

This project explores a **Spotify dataset** using advanced SQL queries.  
The goal is to demonstrate skills in **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and analytical SQL (joins, aggregates, window functions, CTEs)**.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Database Setup**: SQL script to create and populate the `spotify` table.
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: Handling missing/invalid values, unique counts, and dataset exploration.
- **Query Sets**:
  - 🟢 Easy → Basic filtering, counts, and aggregations.
  - 🟡 Medium → Grouped aggregations, top-N analysis, and conditional queries.
  - 🔴 Advanced → Window functions, CTEs, and ratio analysis.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `spotify_projects.sql` → Full SQL script with schema, EDA, and queries.
- `dataset.csv` → Spotify dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md` → Project documentation and overview.

---

## 🚀 Example Queries
- Tracks with more than 1B streams  
- Top 5 most energetic tracks  
- Average danceability by album  
- Cumulative likes by views using window functions  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible with small tweaks)  
- Dataset: Spotify streaming data  

---

## 📊 Future Improvements
- Add **visual dashboards** (Power BI / Tableau).  
- Connect SQL queries to **Python notebooks** for deeper analysis.
